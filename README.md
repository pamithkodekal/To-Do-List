## 👋 Summary for Recruiters

This project demonstrates my ability to:

- Design and implement **core frontend logic independently**
- Use **AI tools responsibly** for UI/UX inspiration (SVG, color systems, visual themes)
- Translate design concepts into **maintainable, production-ready code**
- Own and explain all functional behavior of the application

> **Application logic is human-engineered.  
> UI/UX visuals are AI-assisted and human-curated.**

## 🧠 Responsibility Breakdown (Clear & Ethical)

### 🔹 Human-Written Engineering (Primary Contribution)

All functional and architectural components were implemented manually:

- Task management logic
  - Add tasks
  - Edit/update tasks
  - Mark tasks as completed (strike-through)
- Custom alert system logic
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Application structure and data flow
- Debugging and final integration

**Role:** Frontend Developer / Software Engineer

### 🎨 AI-Assisted UI/UX Design (Design Support)

AI tools were used strictly as **design assistants**, under full human direction, for:

- Visual theme ideation (anime / hacker / ninja aesthetic)
- Color palette selection (neon green on dark backgrounds)
- SVG illustration generation
- Layout and visual hierarchy inspiration

All UI decisions were **reviewed, refined, and implemented manually**.

**Role of AI:** Creative accelerator, not a code author.

---

## 🤝 Human–AI Collaboration Model

This project reflects a modern development workflow where:

- Humans own **logic, architecture, and correctness**
- AI supports **creative exploration and rapid prototyping**
- Final code quality and behavior remain **human responsibility**

This approach aligns with current practices in startups and product teams.
